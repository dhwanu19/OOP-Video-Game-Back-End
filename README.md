# Dungeon-Style Puzzle Game

## Project Overview

The following project is a object-oriented Dungeon-Style video game back end. It is designed to offer players an immersive experience as they navigate through a series of dungeons, overcoming various challenges to achieve specific goals. Developed as a collaborative pair project, I had the privilege of leading the team in management, refactoring and implementation of a previously incomplete project. Together, we refactored and expanded the provided implementation to create an enjoyable, effective video game back-end with a scalable and maintainable codebase. 

### Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language for game logic and backend development.
- **GitLab:** For version control and collaborative development.
- **JSON:** For configuration and layout definition, making the game environment dynamic and easily customizable.
- **JUnit:** Employed for rigorous testing to ensure reliability and performance.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Game Environment:** A grid-based dungeon featuring various entities such as players, walls, exits, treasures, and more, creating a rich and interactive game world.
- **Complex Puzzle Mechanics:** Incorporates item collection, obstacle navigation, and puzzle-solving, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience to players.
- **Design Patterns:** Utilizes Observer for UI and game state synchronization, Strategy for dynamic entity behavior, and Factory for modular entity creation.
- **Agile Development:** As the team leader, I steered our collaborative and agile development process, ensuring a product that is both high-quality and reflective of user needs through continuous requirement analysis, domain modeling, iterative implementation, and testing.

### Object-Oriented Programming Principles

Our development approach extensively applied the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. These principles, coupled with strategic design patterns like Observer, Strategy, and Factory, facilitated a robust, maintainable, and scalable application architecture. My leadership in applying these principles ensured the project’s technical sophistication and success.

### Challenges Overcome

Under my leadership, we innovatively addressed and resolved several significant challenges, including:

#### Game Logic

Developing a robust game logic to manage the complex dynamics and interactions within the game, ensuring coherent and engaging gameplay.

#### Legacy Code Integration

Under my leadership, we tackled the daunting task of integrating new features with legacy systems. This required a deep dive into outdated code, deciphering legacy systems with minimal documentation, and carefully incorporating modern solutions without disrupting the existing functionality.

#### Data Migration and Integrity

A major challenge was ensuring data integrity during the extensive process of migrating data from the old system's schema to the newly refactored backend. We designed and executed complex data migration strategies, ensuring that every piece of data was accurately transferred without loss, maintaining the utmost data integrity even in large datasets.

#### Performance Optimization

We identified and addressed numerous performance bottlenecks inherent in the poorly designed original backend. By optimizing database queries, revising data storage solutions, and implementing efficient caching strategies, we significantly improved the application's response times and overall performance.

#### Scalability Enhancements

The original backend was not built to scale efficiently. We overcame this challenge by redesigning certain components and services, adopting a microservices architecture where feasible, and optimizing resource management to ensure that the application could handle increased loads and user demand gracefully.

#### Testing and Quality Assurance

Ensuring that the refactored backend maintained high quality and did not introduce new bugs was paramount. We established a comprehensive testing framework, incorporating unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to rigorously validate the functionality and performance of the refactored system. This not only ensured a seamless transition but also laid a strong foundation for future development.

## Outcome

The Dungeon-Style Puzzle Game is a testament to our ability to design and develop a sophisticated software system that effectively applies design patterns and adheres to OOP principles. My role as the team leader in this pair project was instrumental in driving the project from concept to completion, showcasing not only technical expertise but also project management and leadership skills.
